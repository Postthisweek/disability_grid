Key: Attempting a grid or table that is fully responsive, accessible, and interactive.

•	Adds labels (data-label) to maintain context on mobile devices.
Accessibility:
•	ARIA labels: Descriptive labels for screen readers.
•	Keyboard navigation: tabindex="0" allows rows to be navigable using the Tab key.
•	Focus indication: focus-within CSS rule provides visual focus for keyboard users.
Interactivity:
